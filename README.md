# AITennisCoach
- This is the repo for sharing the update regarding my IOS app AITennisCoach development. The main purpose of the app is to give people an idea of their NRTP rank if they are not enrolled in the league but want to know their levels, as well as get improve by specific advice.
- The backend of the app is powered by Gemini-2.5-pro. Specific prompting and video processing would speed up the whole process 2x, yet it takes ~30s processing time for a ~30s video input. Now, given the limitation of resources, I release this as an early version test model. I will keep improving that and publish it in the near future, so everyone can have a test. Please see the following video for the early test results. Any feedback would be appreciated.
